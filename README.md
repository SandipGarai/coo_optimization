üéØ Section 1: Biological Inspiration
‚Ä¢	Visual simulation of dogs finding food using their sense of smell
‚Ä¢	Shows scent gradient visualization (green glow around food)
‚Ä¢	Dogs exhibit realistic behaviors: following gradients, zigzagging when lost, cooperation
‚Ä¢	Real-time stats: number of dogs searching, average distance to food, dogs that found food
‚öôÔ∏è Section 2: Algorithm Visualization
‚Ä¢	Two tabs for organizing parameters:
‚Äì	Basic Parameters: Pack configuration, momentum, attraction weights, exploration
‚Äì	Advanced Parameters: Zigzag behavior, elitist exchange, gradient refinement toggles
‚Ä¢	Interactive controls for all hyperparameters with real-time value displays
‚Ä¢	Visual simulation showing multiple packs (different colors) converging to target
‚Ä¢	Four action buttons:
‚Äì	Run Optimization
‚Äì	Reset
‚Äì	Random Hyperparameters (test random configurations)
‚Äì	Find Best Hyperparameters (auto-tune)
‚Ä¢	Real-time statistics: iteration count, best fitness, evaluations, convergence rate
üèîÔ∏è Section 3: Rosenbrock Function Optimization
‚Ä¢	3D colorful visualization of the Rosenbrock function surface
‚Ä¢	Color-coded height map (red = high values, blue/green = low values)
‚Ä¢	Interactive 3D view controls: rotate angle and elevation to see from different perspectives
‚Ä¢	Green marker shows global minimum at (1, 1)
‚Ä¢	Dogs shown as colored dots on the surface
‚Ä¢	Golden ring highlights current best position
‚Ä¢	Statistics tracked: best position found, function value, distance to optimum, success rate
‚Ä¢	Auto-tune button optimized specifically for Rosenbrock function characteristics
